# Managing Your Workflow with R Projects

This repository is an `R Project` used to show the benefits of using `R Studio`'s **Project** feature (in combination with `R Markdown` and `R`) for data analysis, writing papers, and presentations. 

## Instructions

1. Download this repository from GitHub by clicking the green button above and downloading a `.zip` file. 
    - If you have `git` installed on your computer, you can **Clone** and open this repository in `R Studio` instead
2. Open the `.Rproj` file in `R Studio` 

View the **Workflow.presentation** `.pdf` file in the `Presentation/` folder first. It gives an overview of the benefits of `R` **Projects** and a description of the remaining files and folders in this repository. 

I have structured this repository (which is also a folder on your computer) to simulate an effective method of organizing files for writing papers and presentations with data analysis:
    - `Bibliography/` is a folder that contains `.bib` files for references and citations in the main paper 
    - `Data/` is a folder contains data files (in `.csv` form) used for data analysis in `R`
    - `Figures/` is a folder where figures, made from the data, are saved
    - `Scripts/` is a folder where I have saved reproducible scripts for various stages of data analysis 
    - `Presentation/` is a folder for the accompanying presentation slides
    - `Example_paper` is the primary document where the final report will be written and published, drawing relevant resources from the various folders in the repository 
    - `workflow.Rproj` can be opened to view the entire repository in `R Studio`
    
The "paper" created as an example uses fake data that I randomly generated to run some basic summary statistics, plots, and regression models for a report.
