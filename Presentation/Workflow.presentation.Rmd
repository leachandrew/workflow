### Projects

- A **project** is a way of systematically organizing your `R` history, working directory, and related files in a single package
- Can easily be sent to others who can reproduce your work easily 
- Connects well with version control software like GitHub
- Can open multiple projects in multiple windows

### Projects: The Single Solution To Many Problems 

- Projects solve all of the following problems:
    1. Organizing your files (data, plots, text, citations, etc)
    2. Having an accessible working directory (for loading and saving data, plots, etc)
    3. Saving and reloading your commands history and preferences
    4. Sending files to collaborators, so they have the same working directory as you
