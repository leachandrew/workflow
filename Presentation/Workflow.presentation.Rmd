### Projects

- A **project** is a way of systematically organizing your `R` history, working directory, and related files in a single package
- Can easily be sent to others who can reproduce your work easily 
- Connects well with version control software like GitHub
- Can open multiple projects in multiple windows

- Projects negate the need for `setwd()` or sharing 


- Opening up a `.Rproj` allows anyone to take the entire project and replicate or modify it on top 
- You should never use absolute paths in your scripts, because they hinder sharing: no one else will have exactly the same directory configuration as you.
